# the book of life - Jiddu Krishnamurti

> Learning implies the love of understanding and the love of doing a thing for itself.

> ...So when there is the understanding of the whole process of conflict, there is the ending of conflict, there is abundance of energy.

> This authority may be the collective, the State; or it may be the personal, the Master, the savior, the guru. Authority of any kind is blinding,

> to know oneself, one must be aware of oneself in action, which is relationship.

> One must know oneself as one is, not as one wishes to be, which is merely an ideal and therefore fictitious, unreal;

> day—the greedy way I eat, the roughness with which I treat people, the pride, the arrogance, the coarseness of my habits and thoughts—then that very observation transforms what is.

> Understanding of the self requires a great deal of intelligence, a great deal of watchfulness, alertness, watching ceaselessly, so that it does not slip away.

> Become deeply aware

> Dependence sets going the movement of aloofness and attachment, a constant conflict without comprehension,

> Thus there is established a constant awareness which will patiently and gently bring about integration; and if your health and diet are all right, this will in turn bring about fullness of being.

> If we are concerned merely with self-improvement, there is no comprehension of ourselves, of what is.

> Therefore I perceive that there can be “seeing” without thought, which is the word. So the mind is beyond the clutches of ideas, of the conflict of duality and all the rest of it. So, can I look at fear not as an isolated fact?

> The word is memory, and when the word is no longer significant, then the relationship between the experiencer and the experienced is wholly different; then that relationship is direct and not through a word, through memory; then the experiencer is the experience, which alone brings freedom from fear.

> “What shall I do with this desire? It is so ugly, so rampant, so violent,” not giving it a name, a symbol, not covering it with a word—then, is it any longer the cause of turmoil?

> You see a beautiful sunset, a lovely tree, a river that has a wide, curving movement, or a beautiful face, and to look at it gives great pleasure, delight. What is wrong with that? It seems to me the confusion and the misery begin when that face, that river, that cloud, that mountain becomes a memory, and this memory then demands a greater continuity of pleasure; we want such things repeated. We all know this. I have had a certain pleasure, or you have had a certain delight in something, and we want it repeated. Whether it be sexual, artistic, intellectual, or something not quite of this character, we want it repeated—and I think that is where pleasure begins to darken the mind and create values which are false, not actual.

> Are you speculating, or are you actually experiencing as we are going along?

> But such stillness can not be cultivated because if you cultivate a still mind, it is not a still mind, it is a dead mind.

> our lives are obviously very superficial because we do not know how to penetrate deeply.

> only when the mind is not giving continuity to thought, when it is still with a stillness that is not induced, that is without any causation—it is only then that there can be freedom from the background.

> Attention is a state in which the mind is ever learning without a center around which knowledge gathers as accumulated experience.

> What happens when the mind forces itself to pay attention? It creates a resistance to prevent other thoughts from seeping in; it is concerned with resistance, with pushing away; therefore it is incapable of attention.

> The elimination of fear is the beginning of attention. Fear must exist as long as there is an urge to be or to become, which is the pursuit of success, with all its frustrations and tortuous contradictions.

> So attention arises spontaneously when around the student there is an atmosphere of well-being, when he has the feeling of being secure, of being at ease, and is aware of the disinterested action that comes with love. Love does not compare, and so the envy and torture of “becoming” cease.

> A mind that listens with complete attention, will never look for a result because it is constantly unfolding; like a river, it is always in movement. Such a mind is totally unconscious of its own activity,

> To let a thought flower or a feeling flower requires attention—not concentration. I mean by the flowering of a thought giving freedom to it to see what happens, what is taking place in your thought, in your feeling.

> There is silent observation without choice and condemnation, from which there comes understanding.

> ...Please watch your own mind; observe how you explain your sorrows away, lose yourself in work, in ideas, or cling to a belief in God, or in a future life. And if no explanation, no belief has been satisfactory, you escape through drink, through sex, or by becoming cynical, hard, bitter

> Because to think is painful, it creates disturbances, it brings opposition, it may cause one’s actions to go contrary to the established pattern. To think-feel extensionally, to become choicelessly aware may lead to unknown depths, and the mind rebels against the unknown;

> When you know it, when there is an awareness of it, without controlling it, without directing it, without saying, “This is good; this is bad; I’ll keep this; I won’t keep that,”—when you see the total movement of the old mind, when you see it totally, then it becomes quiet.

> I think constant endeavor to be something, to become something, is the real cause of the destructiveness and the aging of the mind. Look how quickly we are aging, not only the people who are over 60, but also the young people. How old they are already, mentally!

> Very few sustain or maintain the quality of a mind that is young. I mean by young not the mind that merely wants to enjoy itself, to have a good time, but the mind that is uncontaminated, that is not scratched, warped, twisted by the accidents and incidents of life, a mind that is not worn out by struggle, by grief, by constant strivings.
