# outliers: the story of success - Malcolm Gladwell

> In Outliers, I want to do for our understanding of success what Stewart Wolf did for our understanding of health.

> “masculinity-femininity scores,”

> “The threshold for getting involved in the business was very low. It’s basically a business built on the sewing machine, and sewing machines don’t cost that much,” says Daniel Soyer, a historian who has written widely on the garment industry.

> Those three things—autonomy, complexity, and a connection between effort and reward—are, most people agree, the three qualities that work has to have if it is to be satisfying. It is not how much money we make that ultimately makes us happy between nine and five. It’s whether our work fulfills us.

> Success is not a random act. It arises out of a predictable and powerful set of circumstances and opportunities,

> The survival of a farmer depends on the cooperation of others in the community. But a herdsman is off by himself.

They are products of history and community, of opportunity and legacy. Their success is not exceptional or mysterious.
